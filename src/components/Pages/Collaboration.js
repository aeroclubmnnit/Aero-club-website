            AeroClub MNNIT is a student body under the Student Activity Centre
            (SAC), MNNIT Allahabad. We, here, congregate students from all over
            the college, not confining to branches but uniting by technology's
            passion. Since the establishment of the club, we have completed
            numerous projects, which do not only serve the purpose of competing
            in events but also solve real-life problems. Our projects cover all
            aerospace sector domains ranging from RC planes to design, from
            aerodynamic analysis to autonomous drones, and then astronomy. We
            are also the birthplace of a fully functional startup, TSAW (link).
            With years of hard work and persistence, we have honed our skills in
            multiple domains in aerospace.
